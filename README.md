-- Assignment 3 Stacks
 A stack implementation typically contains three methods,
 which as push, pop, and peek. 
Push will allow the user to put a single item onto the stack.
 Peek allows the user to see what value is on top of the stack
, and pop allows the user to remove the top value from the
 stack.
 I have used these differents methods and also the isEmpty() to push some fruits on the stack peek to display them and peek to remove one fruit.
