# Assignement1 on singly Linked List 
Like arrays, Linked List is a linear data structure.
Unlike arrays, linked list elements are not stored at 
a contiguous location; the elements are linked using 
pointers.The first element represents the head and 
the the last element represent is the tail
Every element in Linked List is called a node.

## In this assignment i have different methods 
a node constructor 
insertion method to create the Linked List 
insertInfront method to add a node at the head position of the list 
insertAfter() to after a given node
insertAt() to at a particular position
deletIteratively() to delete a node with iterative method 
and printlist() to display
