# Assignment 3 Stacks
A stack implementation typically contains three methods,
which as push, pop, and peek. 
Push will allow the user to put a single item onto the stack.
Peek allows the user to see what value is on top of the stack
,and pop allows the user to remove the top value from the
 stack.

## In this assignment i have used isEmpty()
push() to put 3 fruits onto the stack
pop() to clear a fruit
peek() to show what is in the stack
and display() to to print the result
